## Deploying on Heroku

To get your own Superset App running on Heroku, click the button below:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/sidiber/Apache-superset-deploy-heroku)

Fill out the form, and later you should be performing analytics at the speed of thought.

### Things you should know
##### After deployment

- Superset will be accessible at `YOURAPPNAME.herokuapp.com`.

- To make changes to your app like creating admin user, clone your app locally using the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/):

```sh
heroku git:clone --app YOURAPPNAME
```
- Create an Admin user by using

```sh
heroku run bash --app YOURAPPNAME
fabmanager create-admin --app superset
superset db upgrade
superset init
```

- Check Papertrail logs for debugging any errors.

### How this works

This repository is essentially a minimal web application that specifies [Superset as a dependency](https://github.com/airbnb/superset), and makes a deploy button available.
